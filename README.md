Originally designed as a keycard/keychain for a Hack Club at my highschool, I decided to not go through with printing the design since manufacturing would be too expensive. The original function was to allow a phone to scan a NFC, which would then lead to the club's website. Although not truly finished, I learned a lot about PCB design from this project and will be able to use that information in my next project, which will hopefully actually be printed.
